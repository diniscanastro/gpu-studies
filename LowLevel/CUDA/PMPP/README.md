# Programming Massively Parallel Processors A Hands-on Approach

The programs contained in this folder are extracted from examples and exercises contained in the book by David B. Kirk and Wen-mei W. Hwu, 3rd Edition. As this is a learning exercise, they are subject to errors or malpractices introduced by me so always keep a watchful eye :)

# Compiling 
``` $ nvcc <CUDA File>.cu -o test.out ```

# Running
``` $ ./test.out ```

Please note you can change change the name of `test.out` to any other you wish to.
